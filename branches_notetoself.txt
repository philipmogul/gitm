In future, when working with branches, immediately merge it before doing anymore further commits. 
This is because if i make any more commits, I will have to go through long steps to make the branches be part of the main 

// merging recursively situation
// when git has many branches and many commits had been done so much without merging the branches 
// to merge recursively for inclusion of all branches : 

git merge branchname 

// it will open a terminal, write: 
:wq 

// it will exist with the branch merged
