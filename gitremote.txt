Creating a git remote to push files to GitHub from my pc: 

git remote add origin https://github.com/philipmogul/gitm.git
git push -u origin main


â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line (I found this action works for my command line)
git remote add origin https://github.com/philipmogul/reactwinz.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
